# Attendance Registry System using Computer Vision

This project is a **Facial Recognition-based Attendance Registry System** designed for the **Computer Science Department**. It leverages **Computer Vision techniques** to automatically detect and recognize professors’ faces and mark their attendance with minimal human intervention.

## 🧠 Features

- 🎯 **Face Detection** using OpenCV and Haar cascades or deep learning models.
- 🏷️ **Face Recognition** through trained image datasets (e.g., LBPH, FaceNet).
- 💾 **Database Integration** for storing attendance records (PostgreSQL).
- 🧑‍🏫 **Professor Management**: Add and manage professors' face datasets.
- 📅 **Real-time Attendance Logging** with timestamps.
- 📊 **Reports & Logs**: View and export attendance history.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10**
- **OpenCV** – for face detection and recognition
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **PostgreSQL** – database storage
- **React** – Frontend
